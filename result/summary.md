The main purpose of given assignment is to classify skin lessions. Skin lesions are defined as areas of skin that visually differ from the surrounding tissue. They are relatively common and can develop from a variety of causes, including trauma, genetic factors, infection or autoimmune disorders. 

To support our analysis, we determine the number of hairs in each image and preprocess the images, removing hairs to improve the visibility of the lesions. This pre-processing step improves the accuracy of lesion identification and classification, later helping to distinguish lesions associated with potential diseases from those caused by non-cancerous causes.

To analyze this dataset and perform the requested tasks, we'll need to:

1. Count how many times each person voted for images with rankings 0, 1, or 2.
2. Check when people agreed and disagreed with each other.
3. Identify who agreed the most and least.
4. Plot relevant graphs for visual representation.


### Hair Segmentation Examples
Hair Segenation was conducted using the TELEA method, based on the template code from the lecture. Below are examples of visually successful and unsuccessful results:



### Good results
We can see that hair on these pictures were removed successfully.

### Bad results
Here we can see that there is some remaining hair therefore poor visual results.
